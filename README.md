## Introduction

This repository contains code to help developers and engineers deploy AWS security-related services in an `AWS Control Tower` multi-account environment following patterns that align with the
[AWS Security Reference Architecture](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/security-reference-architecture/). The Amazon Web Services (AWS) Security Reference Architecture (AWS SRA) is a holistic set of guidelines for deploying
the full complement of AWS security services in a multi-account environment.

The AWS service configurations and resources (e.g. IAM roles and policies) deployed by these templates are deliberately very restrictive. They are intended to illustrate an implementation pattern rather than provide a complete solution. You may need
to modify and tailor these solutions to suit your environment and security needs.

The examples within this repository have been deployed and tested within an `AWS Control Tower` environment using `AWS CloudFormation` as well as the `Customizations for AWS Control Tower (CFCT)` solution.

## Getting Started Using the AWS SRA Easy Setup (Recommended)

![How to get started with the easy setup process diagram](./aws_sra_examples/docs/artifacts/easy-setup-process.png)

1. Setup the environment to configure [AWS Control Tower](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/getting-started-with-control-tower.html) within a new or existing AWS account. Existing AWS Control Tower environments can also be used but may require existing service configurations to be removed.
2. Choose a deployment method:
   - AWS CloudFormation StackSets/Stacks - [CFN AWS SRA Easy Setup Implementation Details](./aws_sra_examples/easy_setup#cloudformation-implementation-instructions)
     - See [AWS CloudFormation Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/what-is-cfnstacksets.html) for more information.
   - Customizations for AWS Control Tower (CfCT) - [CfCT AWS SRA Easy Setup Implementation Details](./aws_sra_examples/easy_setup#customizations-for-control-tower-implementation-instructions)
     - See [CfCT Documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/customizations-for-aws-control-tower/) for more information.
3. If using CfCT, deploy the AWSControlTowerExecution role into the management account.
4. Using parameters within the easy setup template file, choose which AWS SRA Solutions to deploy.  This can be done during initial setup or as an update later.

For more information view the [AWS SRA Easy Setup](./aws_sra_examples/easy_setup) solution page.

### AWS SRA Easy Setup

Using the AWS SRA Easy Setup, the common prerequisites and all AWS SRA solutions are automatically packaged, staged, and deployed into your AWS environment with minimal effort.  This is the recommended method to install the AWS SRA code library because it reduces the likelihood of missing a step in the Manual install method.  If using this method to install the AWS SRA code library, there is no other process you need to follow.

Follow the instructions in the [AWS SRA Easy Setup](./aws_sra_examples/easy_setup) solution page to install everything you need to get the AWS SRA code library and it's solutions deployed.

## Manual Install Method For the AWS SRA

![How to get started process diagram (manual install)](./aws_sra_examples/docs/artifacts/where-to-start-process.png)

1. Setup the environment to configure [AWS Control Tower](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/getting-started-with-control-tower.html) within a new or existing AWS account. Existing AWS Control Tower environments can also be used but may require existing service configurations to be removed.
2. Deploy the [Common Prerequisites](aws_sra_examples/solutions/common/common_prerequisites) solution. **Note:** This only needs to be done once for all the solutions.
3. Choose a deployment method:
   - AWS CloudFormation StackSets/Stacks - [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/what-is-cfnstacksets.html)
   - Customizations for AWS Control Tower (CfCT) - [Solution Documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/customizations-for-aws-control-tower/)
4. (Optional) - Deploy the [Customizations for AWS Control Tower (CFCT) Setup](aws_sra_examples/solutions/common/common_cfct_setup) solution. **Note** Only implement if the CFCT deployment method was selected.
5. Per your requirements select one or all of the below [AWS SRA Solutions](#example-solutions) to implement via the selected deployment method.
   -  You may use the `Quick Setup` to deploy the AWS SRA Solutions at this step.

### AWS SRA Quick Setup

The `Quick Setup` can be used along with the manual install of the AWS SRA.  Once you have manually installed the common prerequisites, instead of installing each solution individually, you can deploy all the [Example Solutions](#example-solutions) listed in the below table via a single centralized CloudFormation template either directly within the CloudFormation console or via the Customizations for AWS Control Tower (CFCT) solution. Our testing within an environment that has the default AWS Control Tower setup (3 accounts and 1 region) resulted in deploying all the solutions within the `Quick Setup` in under 20 minutes.  

Follow the instructions within the [Quick Setup](aws_sra_examples/quick_setup) to deploy all or a subset of the solutions based on your environment requirements.

*Note: The `Quick Setup` is not designed to be used with the `Easy Setup` procedure.  Using them together may produce mixed results as we have not tested this.  It is recommended to use the `Easy Setup` process*

## Example Solutions

- **Note:** All solutions below depend on the [Common Prerequisites](aws_sra_examples/solutions/common/common_prerequisites) solution in addition to the specified solutions within the `Depends On` column.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q. How were these particular solutions chosen? A. All the examples in this repository are derived from common patterns that many customers ask us to help them deploy within their environments. We will be adding to the examples over time.

Q. How were these solutions created? A. We’ve collected, cataloged, and curated our multi-account security solution knowledge based on working with a variety of AWS customers.

Q. Who is the audience for these AWS Security Reference Architecture examples? A. Security professionals that are looking for illustrative examples of deploying security patterns in AWS. These code samples provide a starting point from which you can
build and tailor infrastructure for your needs.

Q. Why didn't the solutions use inline Lambda functions within the CloudFormation templates? A. Reasons:

- You should control the dependencies in your function's deployment package as stated in the [best practices for working with AWS Lambda functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/best-practices.html).
- The [AWS Lambda runtimes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html) might not be the latest version, which contains a feature that is needed for the solution.

Q. I have ideas to improve this repository. What should I do? A. Please create an issue or submit a pull request.
