# AWS Security Reference Architecture - Terraform Updates

## Overview of Changes

This document outlines the updates made to the AWS Security Reference Architecture (SRA) Terraform code to implement AWS best practices, security improvements, and modernize the codebase.

## Key Improvements

1. **Provider Version Updates**
   - Updated AWS provider to version 5.31.0+ (from 5.1.0)
   - Added explicit Terraform version requirement (>= 1.0.0)
   - Added proper provider configuration with default tags

2. **S3 Bucket Security Enhancements**
   - Implemented bucket logging for all S3 buckets
   - Added lifecycle configurations for all buckets
   - Enforced SSL/TLS for all S3 operations via bucket policies
   - Changed object ownership to BucketOwnerEnforced (disabling ACLs)
   - Enabled bucket key for server-side encryption to reduce KMS costs
   - Added proper bucket policies to enforce secure access

3. **KMS Key Improvements**
   - Added deletion window for KMS keys
   - Implemented more restrictive KMS key policies
   - Added key rotation for Secrets Manager secrets
   - Enhanced KMS policy permissions to follow least privilege

4. **IAM Security Enhancements**
   - Implemented least privilege principle for IAM roles and policies
   - Added more specific conditions to IAM policies
   - Restricted permissions to necessary actions only

5. **Secrets Manager Improvements**
   - Added rotation for secrets
   - Implemented recovery window for secrets
   - Created Lambda functions for secret rotation

6. **General Security Best Practices**
   - Added proper tagging strategy for all resources
   - Implemented consistent naming conventions
   - Fixed Checkov and Trivy findings
   - Applied terraform fmt to ensure consistent code style

## Implementation Notes

- All S3 buckets now have access logging enabled to a dedicated logging bucket
- All KMS keys have automatic rotation enabled
- Secrets Manager secrets have rotation policies
- IAM policies follow least privilege principle
- All resources have proper tagging for better resource management

## Future Recommendations

1. Consider implementing AWS Organizations Service Control Policies (SCPs) to enforce security guardrails
2. Implement AWS Config rules to monitor compliance
3. Consider using AWS Security Hub for centralized security monitoring
4. Implement AWS CloudTrail for comprehensive audit logging
5. Consider using AWS IAM Access Analyzer to identify unintended resource access
