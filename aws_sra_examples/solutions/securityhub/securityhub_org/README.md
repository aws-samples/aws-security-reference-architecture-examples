## Introduction

The Security Hub Organization solution will automate enabling AWS Security Hub by delegating administration to an account (e.g. Audit or Security Tooling) and configuring Security Hub for all the existing and future AWS Organization accounts.

**Key solution features:**

- Delegates Security Hub administration to another account (i.e Audit account).
- Assumes a role in the delegated administrator account to configure organizations management.
- Adds all existing accounts including the `management account` as members.
- Configures a region aggregator within the `Home region`.
- Assumes a role in each member account to enable/disable standards aligning with the delegated administrator account.
- Ability to disable Security Hub within all accounts and regions via a parameter and CloudFormation update event.

## Deployed Resource Details

![Architecture](./documentation/securityhub-org.png)

### 1.0 Organization Management Account<!-- omit in toc -->

#### 1.1 AWS CloudFormation<!-- omit in toc -->

- All resources are deployed via AWS CloudFormation as a `StackSet` and `Stack Instance` within the `management account` or a CloudFormation `Stack` within a specific account.
- The [Customizations for AWS Control Tower](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/customizations-for-aws-control-tower/) solution deploys all templates as a CloudFormation `StackSet`.
- For parameter details, review the [AWS CloudFormation templates](templates/).

#### 1.2 Lambda IAM Role<!-- omit in toc -->

- The `Lambda IAM Role` is used by the Lambda function to enable the Security Hub Delegated Administrator Account within each region provided.

#### 1.3 Regional Event Rule<!-- omit in toc -->

<!-- - The `AWS Control Tower Lifecycle Event Rule` triggers the `AWS Lambda Function` when a new AWS Account is provisioned through AWS Control Tower. -->
- The `AWS Organizations Event Rule` triggers the `AWS Lambda Function` when updates are made to accounts within the organization.
  - When AWS Accounts are added to the AWS Organization outside of the AWS Control Tower Account Factory. (e.g. account created via AWS Organizations console, account invited from another AWS Organization).
  - When tags are added or updated on AWS Accounts.

#### 1.4 Global Event Rules<!-- omit in toc -->

- If the `Home Region` is different from the `Global Region (e.g. us-east-1)`, then global event rules are created within the `Global Region` to forward events to the `Home Region` default Event Bus.
- The `AWS Organizations Event Rule` forwards AWS Organization account update events.

#### 1.5 SNS Topic<!-- omit in toc -->

- SNS Topic used to fanout the Lambda function for configuring and disabling the service within each account and region.

#### 1.7 AWS Lambda Function<!-- omit in toc -->

- The Lambda function includes logic to enable and configure Security Hub.

#### 1.8 Lambda CloudWatch Log Group<!-- omit in toc -->

- All the `AWS Lambda Function` logs are sent to a CloudWatch Log Group `</aws/lambda/<LambdaFunctionName>` to help with debugging and traceability of the actions performed.
- By default the `AWS Lambda Function` will create the CloudWatch Log Group and logs are encrypted with a CloudWatch Logs service managed encryption key.
- Parameters are provided for changing the default log group retention and encryption KMS key.

#### 1.9 Alarm SNS Topic<!-- omit in toc -->

- SNS Topic used to notify subscribers when messages hit the DLQ.

#### 1.10 Security Hub<!-- omit in toc -->

- A parameter is provided to aggregate all configured Security Hub regions including any future regions.

#### 2.4 Security Hub (Regions)<!-- omit in toc -->

- Security Hub is enabled within each provided region.
- Standards are enabled/disabled based on the provided parameter values.

#### 2.5 Config Recorder Start Event Rule<!-- omit in toc -->

- The `Config Recorder Start Event Rule` sends an event to the management account home region default eventbus when the config recorder is started.
  - AWS Security Hub depends on the AWS Config recorder to be enabled in the account to work properly.
  - AWS Control Tower landing zone organizations may have AWS Config enabled during the account provisioning process.

#### 2.6 EventBridge IAM Role<!-- omit in toc -->

- The `Event Rule IAM Role` is assumed by EventBridge to forward config recorder start events to the `Home Region` default Event Bus.

## Implementation Instructions

### Prerequisites<!-- omit in toc -->

1. [Download and Stage the SRA Solutions](../../../docs/DOWNLOAD-AND-STAGE-SOLUTIONS.md). **Note:** This only needs to be done once for all the solutions.
2. Verify that the [SRA Prerequisites Solution](../../common/common_prerequisites/) has been deployed.
3. Deploy the [Config Management Account](../../config/config_management_account) solution to enable AWS Config within the `management account`.

### Solution Deployment<!-- omit in toc -->

Choose a Deployment Method:

- [AWS CloudFormation](#aws-cloudformation)
- [Customizations for AWS Control Tower](../../../docs/CFCT-DEPLOYMENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md)

#### AWS CloudFormation<!-- omit in toc -->

In the `management account (home region)`, launch an AWS CloudFormation **Stack** using one of the options below:

- **Option 1:** (Recommended) Use the [sra-securityhub-org-main-ssm.yaml](templates/sra-securityhub-org-main-ssm.yaml) template. This is a more automated approach where some of the CloudFormation parameters are populated from SSM parameters created
  by the [SRA Prerequisites Solution](../../common/common_prerequisites/).

  ```bash
  aws cloudformation deploy --template-file $HOME/aws-sra-examples/aws_sra_examples/solutions/securityhub/securityhub_org/templates/sra-securityhub-org-main-ssm.yaml --stack-name sra-securityhub-org-main-ssm --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
  ```

- **Option 2:** Use the [sra-securityhub-org-main.yaml](templates/sra-securityhub-org-main.yaml) template. Input is required for the CloudFormation parameters where the default is not set.

  ```bash
  aws cloudformation deploy --template-file $HOME/aws-sra-examples/aws_sra_examples/solutions/securityhub/securityhub_org/templates/sra-securityhub-org-main.yaml --stack-name sra-securityhub-org-main --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM --parameter-overrides pAuditAccountId=<AUDIT_ACCOUNT_ID> pOrganizationId=<ORGANIZATION_ID> pRootOrganizationalUnitId=<ROOT_ORGANIZATIONAL_UNIT_ID> pSRAStagingS3BucketName=<SRA_STAGING_S3_BUCKET_NAME>
  ```

#### Verify Solution Deployment<!-- omit in toc -->

1. Log into the `management account` and navigate to the Security Hub page
   1. Select Settings and then General
   1. Verify that the delegated admin account is set for each region
2. Log into the Audit account and navigate to the Security Hub page

   2. Verify all existing accounts have been enabled and auto enabled is ON
   3. Verify the region aggregator is configured
   4. Verify the Auto-enable new controls is ON
3. Log into a member account and verify the standards are configured correctly

#### Solution Update Instructions<!-- omit in toc -->

**Note:** To update the standard version (e.g. CIS 1.2.0 to CIS 1.4.0), first disable the standard and then enable with the new version.

1. [Download and Stage the SRA Solutions](../../../docs/DOWNLOAD-AND-STAGE-SOLUTIONS.md). **Note:** Get the latest code and run the staging script.
2. Update the existing CloudFormation Stack or CFCT configuration. **Note:** Make sure to update the `SRA Solution Version` parameter and any new added parameters.

#### Solution Delete Instructions<!-- omit in toc -->

1. In the `management account (home region)`, change the `Disable Security Hub` parameter to `true` and update the AWS CloudFormation **Stack** (`sra-securityhub-org-main-ssm` or `sra-securityhub-org-main`).
2. In the `management account (home region)`, verify that the Lambda function processing is complete by confirming no more CloudWatch logs are generated.
3. In the `management account (home region)`, delete the AWS CloudFormation **Stack** (`sra-securityhub-org-main-ssm` or `sra-securityhub-org-main`).
4. In the `management account (home region)`, delete the AWS CloudWatch **Log Group** (e.g. /aws/lambda/<solution_name>) for the Lambda function deployed.

#### Instructions to Manually Run the Lambda Function<!-- omit in toc -->

1. In the `management account (home region)`.
2. Navigate to the AWS Lambda Functions page.
3. Select the `checkbox` next to the Lambda Function and select `Test` from the `Actions` menu.
